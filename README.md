# Cpp-Experiments
Refine the Money class by adding a currency (given as a constructor argument). Accept a floatingpoint initializer as long as
it can be exactly represented as a long int. Don’t accept illegal operations, for example, Money*Money doesn’t make sense,
and USD1.23 + DKK5.00 makes sense only if you provide a conversion table defining the conversion factor between U.S. dollars (USD)
and Danish kroner (DKK).
